            <h1>Idea Of Starting A Trust</h1>

            <p>My Dream was already to setup a NGO which helps poor by providing them a house and all facilities they need.
                <br> So My father gave me a suggestion to start a Trust and donate money per month and that money would be given to the one in Need.</br> 
                I then only statred building a website from where everyone can donate and know about our portfolio so this is all About How we started.
